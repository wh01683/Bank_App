/*The goal of the facade pattern is to simplify a group of subsystems
 * by making a unified interface to group all the subsystems. the implemented
 * Systems have no knowledge of the facade; they have no instance of the facade.*/

/*The purpose of this application is to demonstrate understanding and possible uses 
 * of the Facade pattern. I will create a bank themed application which will implement a 
 * checking account application class as the facade class. Subclasses will include bank account
 * information like ChexSystems report (the banking equivalent of a credit check), available balance
 * to open with, check basic customer information like age, etc*/
